# FaaS-environment-config
A Terraform module for deploying Lambda functions with an API gateway from an S3 bucket.

These branches are important:

- `master` - main production branch
- `develop` - original and default development branch
- `test` - Added for development of GoodFood Lambdas, but not merged (and currently used by production pipeline for deploying those Lambda functions).

Note: we need to merge the test branch eventually, it needs careful unpicking.
