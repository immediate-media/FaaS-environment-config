# FaaS-environment-config
A Terraform module for deploying Lambda functions with an API gateway from an S3 bucket

There are two branches that should be considered *production* branches:

- `develop` - original FaaS development track this branch.
- `test` - This branch is used for GoodFood lambdas - we need to merge it eventually, but for now consider it a *production* branch.
